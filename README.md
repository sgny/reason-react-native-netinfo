# BuckleScript bindings to React Native NetInfo

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/reason-react-native-netinfo.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reason-react-native-netinfo)

These are BuckleScript bindings to [`React Native NetInfo`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo), in Reason syntax. `NetInfo` has been removed in RN 0.60, but as that release has breaking changes, this package is intended to work with previous RN releases as well. Accordingly, to avoid namespace clashes with the `NetInfo` module in `reason-react-native` (as would happen with `open React Native`), the module has been named `CommunityNetInfo`. In future releases, it is intended that the module be renamed `NetInfo`.

Version of these bindings follow that of the `React Native NetInfo` package.

Documentation will be added later.
